## Introduction

This is my take on the tic-tac-toe project for the final Mod 1 project.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Contributors
  - [Janika Hortizuela](https://github.com/jhortizu01)

## Features

This cool little tic-tac-toe app is styled in the theme of Cat in the Hat. Features include:

  - Score keeping for both player one and player two on each side of the screen.
  - In the top middle it keeps track of who's turn it is by displaying the players token.
  - If there is a win or a draw it is displayed at the top of the screen.
  - When the game is completed the board is cleared off after a few seconds and the app displays the next players turn at the top of the window.
  - When you leave the app and come back to it, your scores are saved and displayed on each side of the screen.
